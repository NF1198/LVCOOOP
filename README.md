# LV Common Objects for Object Oriented Programming (LVCOOP)

LVCOOP is a set of common objects that support building robust object oriented applications with LabVIEW(tm).

## Lookup API

The Lookup API is depenency mangament pattern that allows you to inject instances of objects into your application at runtime instead of hard-coding them throughout your application. This is a powerful tool that supports building modular, reusable, and testable code.
